To run:
```
git clone
npm install
npm start
```

Click the "Download this" link. Save it. Note that it is saved without a file extension. `find ~/Downloads -name "*ron-swanson*"` to confirm that. 

Now download in Chrome (you can just go to JSBin or something and paste this into the HTML `<a href="https://cameronnokes.com/slack-ron-swanson-quote-bot/ron-swanson.jpg" download>Download this</a>`). Note that it saves with a file extension.
